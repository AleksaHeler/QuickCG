    Tutorial and copyright: https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html

    Semi 3D raycasting engine. Takes a map (2d matrix of integers which represent 
    what is there) and draws elements "3D" by varying the height based on distance.

    This has limitations: there is no height difference in map (stairs) or jumping.
    But it works fast and is easy to make and will be used in projects.

    In the way presented in this tutorial, an algorithm is used that's based on DDA 
    or "Digital Differential Analysis". DDA is a fast algorithm typically used on 
    square grids to find which squares a line hits (for example to draw a line on a 
    screen, which is a grid of square pixels). So we can also use it to find which 
    squares of the map our ray hits, and stop the algorithm once a square that is 
    a wall is hit.

/* The map of the world is a 2D array, where each value represents a square 
   If the value is 0, that square represents an empty, walkthroughable square, and if 
   the value is higher than 0, it represents a wall with  a certain color or texture.
   The map declared here is very small, only 24 by 24 squares, and is defined directly 
   in the code. For a real game, like Wolfenstein 3D, you use a bigger map and load it 
   from a file instead. All the zero's in the grid are empty space, so basicly you see 
   a very big room, with a wall around it (the values 1), a small room inside it (the 
   values 2), a few pilars (the values 3), and a corridor with a room (the values 4). */
